# Troubleshooting

Each entry leads with the literal fix and then explains the why.

## Measurement variability

### Numbers are uniformly slow and not production-representative

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Rebuild with `dotnet run -c Release` (or set the configuration to Release in your IDE) and detach the debugger.

The entry assembly was built in `Debug` configuration (common with `dotnet run` without `-c Release`), or a debugger is attached. Both defeat JIT inlining and tier-1 optimization. If measuring Debug behavior is intentional, suppress the warning with `NBENCHMARK_SUPPRESS_DEBUG_WARNING=1` or `new MeasurementOptions { Environment = new EnvironmentOptions { SuppressBuildConfigurationWarning = true } }`.

### Large Error (wide confidence interval)

> [!CAUTION] Pick one based on the cause
> **Demand a tighter target:** `.WithAutoTune(AutoTunePreset.Thorough)` or `--ci-target 0.01`
> **Raise the sample ceiling:** `--max-samples <n>` and `--max-tuning-time <s>` if the loop is stopping on a cap
> **Reduce OS scheduling noise:** switch outlier mode to `.WithOutlierMode(OutlierMode.IqrFence)` (the default; if you changed it, change it back)
> **Stabilise a hot laptop:** `--warmup 50` to let the CPU stabilise, and run plugged in

A wide confidence interval means genuinely variable timings. In auto-sampling mode NBenchmark keeps collecting samples until the Error meets the precision target, so a wide interval usually points to real run-to-run variability rather than too few samples. The right remedy depends on the cause: a tight target for slow-but-stable bodies, a higher sample ceiling for fast-but-noisy ones, an outlier-mode change for OS noise, or a longer warmup for thermal ramps.

See [Configuration: AutoTune](./reference/configuration.md#autotune) for the `Thorough` preset and [Configuration: OutlierMode](./reference/configuration.md#outliermode) for the outlier modes.

### Same benchmark, a different median each run, and every run reports a tight Error

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Raise the warmup floor: `--min-warmup-time <ms>` (default 500) and `--max-warmup <n>` if the ceiling is what cut warmup short. For a nanosecond body with `--ops-per-sample 1`, raise the ops-per-sample so each sample spans more work.

Warmup ended before the JIT finished tiering the body up, so the run measured pre-tier-1 (unoptimized) code. This is **not** noise: each run is internally consistent, which is why the error margin looks trustworthy. A body can read several times slow this way.

Confirm the cause before fixing it. Check `autoTune.warmupTimeFloorMet` in the JSON (or `warmup cut short` on the console summary), `autoTune.jitQuiescenceAchieved`, and `autoTune.splitHalfDrift`. `autoTune.warmupCurve` shows whether the body was still speeding up when warmup ended, and `autoTune.jitLastChangeAtNs` against `warmupElapsedNs` shows how much quiet time followed the last compilation.

See [Measurement: Warmup](./statistics/measurement.md#phase-2---warmup-plateau-detection) and [the warmup curve](./statistics/measurement.md#the-warmup-curve) for the full mechanism.

### Tight Error next to a `maxCeiling` stop, or next to a Max hundreds of times the median

> [!CAUTION] Pick one
> **Accept the variance as the finding:** `--launch-count 5` (the honest signal of run-to-run spread across launches)
> **Chase precision:** raise `--max-samples` and loosen `--ci-target` (e.g. `--ci-target 0.05`)

The reported Error is computed on the **trimmed** set while the loop's stop rule ran on the **raw** stream. When the variance lives in the outliers, trimming removes it and the reported margin tightens around what remains. A benchmark can show `MarginOfError` at ±1.3% of its mean while `autoTune.achievedRelativeCiWidth` is `1.05` (±105%). Neither number is wrong; they describe different sample sets.

Read `autoTune.sampleStop` before the Error column: a tight margin is evidence the measurement *converged* only when it reads `ciTargetMet`. Compare `autoTune.achievedRelativeCiWidth` against `marginOfError / mean`, and check `outliersRemoved` against the pre-trim sample count.

See [Raw vs. trimmed statistics](./statistics/measurement.md#raw-vs-trimmed-statistics) for the full mechanism.

### Result reports a `driftUnresolved` stop

> [!CAUTION] Pick one
> **Land the transition during warmup instead:** `--min-warmup-time <ms>` (raise it; the default is 500 ms)
> **Accept non-stationarity as the finding:** `--launch-count 5` to measure the across-launch spread, which is the honest signal

The measured timings kept moving while they were being collected, so the interval describes a moving target. Usually a JIT tier-up or dynamic-PGO re-optimization landing inside measurement; otherwise a thermal ramp, a filling cache, or a growing data structure.

See [Measurement: Steady-state (drift) gate](./statistics/measurement.md#phase-3---measurement-ci-width-target) for the drift detection mechanism and the restart limit.

### Sample count varies between runs

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Expected - this is auto-sampling working as designed. Pin `.WithIterations(n)` / `--iterations n` for a fixed, reproducible sample count (e.g. in CI).

Each run collects exactly enough samples to hit the CI target. Pin a fixed count only when you need reproducibility across runs (CI dashboards, regression baselines).

See [Configuration: Iterations](./reference/configuration.md#iterations).

### High StdDev

> [!CAUTION] Pick one
> **Diagnose allocation pressure:** enable allocation tracking with `.WithAllocations()` and read the `Alloc/op` column
> **Isolate iterations from GC noise:** switch to the `Independent` profile (`--profile independent`) to force per-iteration GC

A high standard deviation means timings are inconsistent. Under the default `Realistic` profile, natural GC pauses are included in the timing; allocation pressure from the body produces a noisy tail. The `Independent` profile forces a Gen0 GC before every iteration so GC pauses are deterministic rather than random, which removes them from the variance (at the cost of ecological validity).

See [Measurement Profiles](./statistics/measurement.md#measurement-profiles) for the worked example and [Configuration: MeasureAllocations](./reference/configuration.md#measureallocations).

### Bimodal-distribution warning

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
>
> 1. **Check the body** for **lock contention** or **cache misses** - the cluster centre in the warning names the extra cost the slow path pays.
> 2. **If you suspect GC:** `dotnet run -- --profile independent` (forces per-iteration Gen0 collection, making GC pauses deterministic rather than bimodal).

The outlier detector found a tight secondary cluster of slow timings rather than scattered noise - a real, repeatable slow path in the code. The reported median describes the fast path; the cluster centre describes a latency a real user will also hit. The warning is non-fatal: the benchmark still completes and reports statistics on the trimmed (fast-cluster) set.

Do not silence it. Read the tail metrics as-is - by default the histogram and P99/P99.9/Max are computed from the full pre-trim distribution, so the cluster is still visible there. Investigate the cause with a profiler, and reduce noise at the source with [environment control](./features/environment-control.md) if OS scheduling contributed to the spread.

See [Outlier Trimming: Bimodal-distribution warning](./statistics/outliers.md#bimodal-distribution-warning) for the detector, the common-cause table, and the interaction with each outlier mode.

## Zero or unexpected results

### Result shows `0 ns`

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Use the `Func<T>` overload that returns a value: `Benchmark.Run(() => ComputeHash(data))`. Or add a side effect to the body.

Dead code elimination - the compiler removed your benchmark body because it has no observable side effects. A returning overload writes the return value to a static field so the JIT cannot elide the call.

See [FAQ: `0 ns`](./faq.md#my-benchmark-produces-0-ns-whats-happening).

### All results zeroed

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Remove the `--dry-run` flag, or set `Iterations` > 0.

Dry-run mode is active (`--dry-run`, or `Iterations=0` and `WarmupIterations=0`). The body is not invoked and no measurements are taken. `--dry-run` validates discovery and wiring; to run the body exactly once for a smoke test, use `--iterations 1 --warmup 0`.

### `MarginOfError` is `±0 ns`

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Unpin `Iterations` to use auto mode (collects at least `AutoTune.MinSamples`), or pin a larger count.

Either only one sample was collected (`n < 2`, from a pinned `Iterations = 1`) or all measurements were identical (timer resolution coarser than the benchmark duration). For a fast body, auto ops-per-sample calibration amortises a coarse timer - note that calibration is skipped when setup/teardown is set.

### `Sig` column is blank

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Increase iterations or combine more runs: `--iterations <n>` or `--min-samples <n>`.

Too few samples for the significance test (requires ≥2 per group), **or** the Kruskal-Wallis omnibus was not significant (three-plus benchmarks compared, no post-hoc ran). In the second case the blank is correct - the omnibus gate refused to run pairwise comparisons because the groups look the same.

See [FAQ: significance](./faq.md#why-is-significance-sometimes-blank) and [Significance Testing](./statistics/significance.md) for the omnibus gate.

## Discovery and setup errors

### `[Benchmark]` method not discovered

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Run `dotnet run -- --list` to verify what the host finds, then check the class is public, not abstract, and the method is an instance method (not static).

The host scans for public instance methods marked `[Benchmark]` on public, non-abstract classes. Static methods, abstract classes, and assemblies not registered with `AddFromAssembly` are not discovered.

See [Harness mode: listing benchmarks without running](./usage-modes/harness-mode.md#listing-benchmarks-without-running).

### "Could not instantiate MyClass"

> [!CAUTION] Pick one
> **Add a public parameterless constructor** to the benchmark class (simplest fix if the class has no real dependencies)
> **Install `NBenchmark.Analyzers`** for compile-time detection of NB0001 (missing parameterless constructor)
> **Use dependency injection:** add the `NBenchmark.DependencyInjection` package and `UseDependencyInjection<T>(BuildServices)` with a static `IServiceProvider BuildServices()` factory, so the worker rebuilds the container and the run stays isolated

The host uses `Activator.CreateInstance`, which requires a public parameterless constructor. Benchmark classes with real dependencies (a repository, a logger, an `HttpClient`, a `DbContext`) need the DI companion package.

See [Dependency Injection](./features/dependency-injection.md) for the full API and [FAQ: instantiation](./faq.md#the-host-throws-could-not-instantiate-myclass-how-do-i-fix-it).

### "Could not load file or assembly" from an ASP.NET Core or WPF project

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> Rebuild, so the `runtimeconfig.json` beside the assembly under test is present and current. That file is how the worker learns which shared frameworks to ask for.

Benchmarks that live in a `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` (or WinForms/WPF) project run in an assembly whose dependency graph reaches a shared framework — `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` or `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App`. Those assemblies ship with the framework rather than in your output directory, so they are absent from your project's `deps.json` and are expected to be supplied by the process. The measurement worker is a plain console application, so on its own it supplies only `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, and the load fails with a message naming an assembly that is not actually missing from disk — `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions` is the usual one.

The framework set is now extended automatically: before launching the worker, NBenchmark reads the `runtimeconfig.json` beside the assembly under test and adds any framework the worker does not already declare. `dotnet benchmark` does the same thing for itself — unlike every other mode it loads the target into its own process to discover benchmarks, so it restarts once under the right framework set before reading anything. Nothing needs configuring, and nothing changes for an ordinary console benchmark project.

Two cases remain:

- **No `runtimeconfig.json` beside the assembly**, or a stale one. Rebuild the project. The fault message names the frameworks the worker was actually started with, so it is clear when this is what happened.
- **A self-contained (`--self-contained`) target.** Its framework lives in its own output directory, so there is no shared framework to request. Build the benchmark project framework-dependent, or pass `--in-process` and accept host-fidelity numbers.

### Benchmarks run in a different order each time

> [!CAUTION] Quick fix
> `--order declaration` or `.WithRunOrder(RunOrder.Declaration)` for source order.

Random order is the default and prevents systematic bias (the first benchmark always benefits from a warm CPU cache). Pin declaration order for reproducibility across CI and local, or use `--seed <n>` for a reproducible shuffle.

See [Configuration: ForceGcBetweenBenchmarks](./reference/configuration.md#forcegcbetweenbenchmarks) (the run-order option lives in the same reference).

## Quick reference: Outlier modes

| Mode | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `IqrFence` (default) | General-purpose. The [IQR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range)-based fence adapts to your data's spread, trimming spikes from OS scheduling interrupts without discarding clean samples. |
| `RemoveTop5Percent` | When you want a fixed quota - always removes the slowest 5% of iterations. |
| `RemoveTopAndBottom5Percent` | When very fast outliers (e.g. cache hits after warmup) also skew results. |
| `None` | When every sample matters (latency-tail analysis). |
