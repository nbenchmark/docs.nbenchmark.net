# Analyzers

`NBenchmark.Analyzers` provides a set of Roslyn diagnostic analyzers that detect configuration issues at edit time. Install the package to get live warnings and errors in your IDE and during `dotnet build`.

## Setup

Add the analyzers package to your project:

```bash
dotnet add package NBenchmark.Analyzers
```

The analyzers run automatically without additional configuration. The package includes both analyzers (diagnostics) and code fixes (automatic corrections).

## Diagnostic reference

### NB0001 - Missing parameterless constructor

This diagnostic applies to any class or record that contains declared `[Benchmark]` methods but lacks a public parameterless constructor. NBenchmark uses `Activator.CreateInstance` by default, which requires this constructor. Structs are not flagged because their implicit zero-init constructor satisfies the discovery pipeline.

```csharp
// Bad - no public parameterless constructor
public class MyBenchmarks
{
    private readonly IDependency _dep;

    public MyBenchmarks(IDependency dep) { _dep = dep; }

    [Benchmark]
    public void Measure() { }
}
```

To fix this, you can:
1. Add a public parameterless constructor.
2. Use `NBenchmark.DependencyInjection` to resolve from a DI container.

### NB0002 - Static benchmark method

The `[Benchmark]` discovery pipeline only looks for instance methods. NBenchmark silently skips static methods.

```csharp
// Bad
[Benchmark]
public static void Measure() { }

// Good
[Benchmark]
public void Measure() { }
```

This diagnostic includes an automatic code fix that removes the `static` keyword.

### NB0003 - BenchmarkCase arity mismatch

The `[BenchmarkCase]` attribute must match the method's parameter count. Each attribute corresponds to one invocation of the method. When using `[BenchmarkCases]`, the source method must yield tuples whose arity matches the benchmark method's parameter count.

```csharp
// Bad - method takes no parameters but has [BenchmarkCase]
[BenchmarkCase(42)]
[Benchmark]
public void Measure() { }

// Bad - method expects one parameter, argument supplies none
[BenchmarkCase]
[Benchmark]
public void Measure(int x) { }

// Bad - [BenchmarkCases] source yields tuple with wrong arity
[BenchmarkCases(nameof(Cases))]
[Benchmark]
public void Measure(int x, int y) { }

public static IEnumerable<(int a,)> Cases() { yield return (1,); } // arity 1, expected 2
```

### NB0004 / NB0005 - No observable side effects

If a `[Benchmark]` method body contains only pure operations (such as local variable assignments, empty loops, or no method calls), the JIT may optimize the entire body away. This results in 0 ns measurements.

NBenchmark uses a syntax-level heuristic to detect bodies with no observable side effects. A body is flagged if it lacks:
- Method calls
- Field or property writes
- `ref` or `out` arguments
- `return` statements with values
- `await` expressions
- Object or array allocations

These diagnostics have `Error` severity in harness mode because a benchmark with no observable work is an invalid definition. The build fails so you can catch the problem in CI/CD before the suite runs.

```csharp
// Bad - build fails with NB0005
[Benchmark]
public void Empty() { }

// Bad - build fails with NB0004
[Benchmark]
public void PureLoop() { for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { } }

// Good - side effect through a consumed return value
[Benchmark]
public int Measure() { return Compute(); }

// Good - observable side effect
[Benchmark]
public void Mutate() { _counter++; }
```

If the work happens outside the method syntax (for example, via native interop or external state mutation), suppress the diagnostic locally:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable NBenchmark.NB0004 // P/Invoke call mutates native state
[Benchmark]
public void NativeBuffer()
{
    NativeMethods.FillBuffer(_buffer);
}
#pragma warning restore NBenchmark.NB0004
```

You can also lower the severity project-wide in `.editorconfig`:

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.NB0004.severity = warning
dotnet_diagnostic.NB0005.severity = warning
```

### NB0006 - Multiple baselines

Only one benchmark per class can be the baseline. When multiple methods have `Baseline = true`, NBenchmark uses the first discovered method and ignores the others.

```csharp
// Bad
[Benchmark(Baseline = true)] public void MethodA() { }
[Benchmark(Baseline = true)] public void MethodB() { }
```

### NB0007 - Duplicate lifecycle methods

Each lifecycle attribute (`[BenchmarkSetup]`, `[BenchmarkTeardown]`, `[BenchmarkIterationSetup]`, `[BenchmarkIterationTeardown]`) should appear at most once per class. If two methods share the same attribute, NBenchmark silently ignores the second one.

```csharp
// Bad - duplicate [BenchmarkSetup]
[BenchmarkSetup] public void Init() { }
[BenchmarkSetup] public void InitAgain() { }
```

### NB0008 / NB0009 - Range violations

NBenchmark checks `[Benchmark]` attribute properties and `MeasurementOptions` values against their valid ranges at compile time to prevent `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` at runtime.

```csharp
// Bad - Iterations exceeds MaxIterations (100,000)
[Benchmark(Iterations = 200000)]
public void Measure() { }

// Bad - ConfidenceLevel must be strictly between 0 and 1
var opts = new MeasurementOptions { ConfidenceLevel = 1.5 };

// Bad - 'with' expression is also checked
var opts2 = new MeasurementOptions() with { Iterations = 200000 };
```

### NB0010 - Throwaway lambda body

When a lambda passed to an `Action` overload of `Benchmark.Run*` has no observable side effects, the JIT may eliminate it. An empty lambda or one that only assigns to a local variable has no observable effect on the program state.

NB0010 is a `Warning` because Single mode is intended for ad-hoc exploration. Warnings do not break the build, allowing you to iterate.

```csharp
// Warning - empty lambda, nothing to measure
Benchmark.Run(() => { });

// Warning - assigns to a local; local is discarded
Benchmark.Run(() => { var x = 42; });

// No warning - has observable side effects
Benchmark.Run(() => { _x = 42; });
Benchmark.Run(() => Compute());
```

Value-returning overloads (such as `Benchmark.Run<T>`) are not flagged because NBenchmark consumes the returned value, which prevents dead-code elimination.

### NB0011 - `PerClass` lifetime with scoped service

When a class uses `[InstanceLifetime(InstanceLifetime.PerClass)]`, all `[Benchmark]` methods in that class share one object instance. If the class constructor injects a dependency that may hold per-instance state, one method can warm caches that the next method reads, distorting the timing.

The analyzer flags any non-primitive, non-ambient reference-type constructor parameter on a class with two or more `[Benchmark]` methods. Well-known stateless types (such as `ILogger` and `IOptions<T>`) and ambient types (such as `HttpContext`) are excluded. Non-public constructors are also inspected.

```csharp
// Warning NB0011
[InstanceLifetime(InstanceLifetime.PerClass)]
public sealed class OrderBenchmarks(MyDbContext db)
{
    [Benchmark] public int A() => db.Orders.Count();
    [Benchmark] public int B() => db.Orders.Where(o => o.Total > 100).Count();
}
```

The fluent default also triggers this warning. If `BenchmarkHarness.WithInstanceLifetime(InstanceLifetime.PerClass)` is called, every discovered class in the assembly is treated as `PerClass`.

An empty `IStateReset` is also flagged:

```csharp
// Still warning NB0011: resets nothing
[InstanceLifetime(InstanceLifetime.PerClass)]
public sealed class OrderBenchmarks(MyDbContext db) : IStateReset
{
    public Task ResetAsync(CancellationToken ct) => Task.CompletedTask;
    ...
}
```

The engine can only check for the presence of the interface; the analyzer reads the method body to ensure the reset is not empty. If the carry-over is deliberate, use `[SharedState]`.

**Why this matters**: The Mann-Whitney U test assumes samples are independent. When method A warms a shared cache that method B reads, method B's timings are artificially linked to method A running first. This breaks the statistical model and makes the significance verdict unreliable.

To fix this, you can:
1. Remove the attribute to use `PerMethod` lifetime.
2. Implement `IStateReset` to reset shared state between methods.
3. Add `[SharedState]` if the carry-over is intentional.
4. Suppress the warning with `#pragma warning disable NB0011`.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a compile-time warning. If you suppress NB0011, verify that shared state does not create timing dependencies by running each method in isolation and comparing results.

### NB0012 - `[BenchmarkCases]` cannot be combined with `[BenchmarkCase]`

A method cannot carry both attributes. `[BenchmarkCase]` declares literal cases inline, while `[BenchmarkCases]` names a programmatic source. Combining them is ambiguous and results in an error.

```csharp
// Error NB0012: both attributes on one method
[BenchmarkCase(10)]
[BenchmarkCases(nameof(SortCases))]
[Benchmark]
public void Sort(int size) { }

static IEnumerable<(int Size, string Label)> SortCases() => ...
```

Use one or the other. For small literal lists, use `[BenchmarkCase]`. For generated values or parameter sweeps, use `[BenchmarkCases]`. See [Parameterized benchmarks: Harness mode](../features/parameterized-harness.md) for a full comparison.

### NB0013 - `PerClass` lifetime with mutable instance field

When a class uses `[InstanceLifetime(InstanceLifetime.PerClass)]` and has a non-`readonly` instance field accessed by at least two `[Benchmark]` methods, the field can carry warmed state between methods. This violates the statistical-independence assumption.

```csharp
// Warning NB0013
[InstanceLifetime(InstanceLifetime.PerClass)]
public sealed class CacheBenchmarks
{
    private int _counter;

    [Benchmark] public int A() => _counter++;
    [Benchmark] public int B() => _counter++;
}
```

To fix this:
1. Remove the attribute to use `PerMethod` lifetime.
2. Make the field `readonly` if it is only assigned once.
3. Suppress the warning with `#pragma warning disable NB0013` if sharing state is intentional.

### NB0014 - Capturing body cannot be isolated

NBenchmark measures benchmark bodies in a separate worker process. It achieves this by resolving the method the compiler emitted. Because a lambda that captures state cannot be addressed this way, NBenchmark sends the captured *values* instead.

Most ordinary data is sent faithfully and the benchmark remains isolated. However, a value whose behavior is not determined by its contents (such as a `Stream` or a collection with a custom comparer) is refused, and the run fails.

```csharp
var data = BuildInput();

// Info NB0014: captures 'data'
Benchmark.Run(() => Process(data));
```

NB0014 is an `Info` diagnostic, not a warning, because capturing is the idiomatic way to benchmark over prepared data.

| Body | Isolated? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `() => 43` | yes | Nothing to carry. |
| `static () => 43` | yes | Identical to above. |
| `() => Work(local)` | if `local` is faithful | Types like `int`, `string`, or `int[]` are sent by value. `Stream` is not. |
| `() => Work(_field)` | if `this` is faithful | Captures `this`; every field must qualify. |
| `() => Work(StaticField)` | yes | Static fields need no receiver. |
| `widget.Compute` | if `widget` is faithful | The receiver is walked field by field. |
| `() => Work(shapes)` | no | Collections are sent against their element type; overrides are lost. |
| `() => Work(local)` in `Method<T>` | if `local` is faithful | Closure is rebuilt against the same type arguments. |
| `() => 43` beside `() => local` | yes | Non-capturing lambdas remain isolated. |

If a body is part of a `BenchmarkSuite`, it is measured by a worker. If one body cannot be isolated, the entire suite falls back to the host process.

```csharp
var data = BuildInput();

await new BenchmarkSuite("Sorting")
    // Info NB0014: captures 'data' - the whole suite falls back to this process
    .Add("Sort", () => Array.Sort(data))
    .Add("Own", () => { var own = BuildInput(); Array.Sort(own); })
    .RunAsync();
```

To isolate the body, move the state creation inside the lambda:

```csharp
// No capture: the body builds what it needs
Benchmark.Run(() => Process(BuildInput()));
```

Alternatively, use a `[Benchmark]` class. Discovery runs inside the worker, so `[BenchmarkSetup]` and fields are built locally:

```csharp
public class ProcessBenchmarks
{
    private Input _data = null!;

    [BenchmarkSetup] public void Setup() => _data = BuildInput();

    [Benchmark] public Output Run() => Process(_data);
}
```

### NB0015 - Conflicting isolation attributes

`[InProcess]` and `[IsolatedProcess]` are contradictory. Applying both to the same member results in an error.

```csharp
public class MyBenchmarks
{
    // Error NB0015
    [Benchmark, InProcess, IsolatedProcess]
    public void Both() { }
}
```

A method-level attribute overriding a class-level attribute is allowed and is the documented way to force a specific isolation mode.

## Runtime independence warning

In addition to compile-time analyzers, NBenchmark emits a runtime warning on `BenchmarkResult.Warnings` when a class runs under `InstanceLifetime.PerClass` with multiple `[Benchmark]` methods but declares neither `IStateReset` nor `[SharedState]`. This covers cases where the analyzer is not installed or in suite mode.

To opt out, declare `[SharedState]` on the class:

```csharp
[InstanceLifetime(InstanceLifetime.PerClass)]
[SharedState] // measuring the warm-cache path is the point
public class CacheBenchmarks { }
```

You can also suppress this warning for the entire run by setting `SuppressPerClassIndependenceWarning = true` on `MeasurementOptions`.

## Disabling a rule

Use a `#pragma` directive to suppress a specific diagnostic. Always include a comment explaining why:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable NBenchmark.NB0004 // P/Invoke mutates native state
[Benchmark]
public void Measure()
{
    NativeMethods.FillBuffer(_buffer);
}
#pragma warning restore NBenchmark.NB0004
```

Alternatively, set the severity in `.editorconfig`:

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.NB0004.severity = none
```

## Severity

- **Errors**: The benchmark cannot run or will produce meaningless results. (NB0002, NB0003, NB0004, NB0005, NB0006, NB0007, NB0008, NB0009, NB0015).
- **Warnings**: The code can run, but measurements may be invalid. (NB0001, NB0010, NB0011, NB0013).
- **Info**: The measurement is fine, but the mechanism is worth noting. (NB0014).

You can override any severity in `.editorconfig`.
