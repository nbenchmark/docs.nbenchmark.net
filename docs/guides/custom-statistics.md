# Custom statistics

## Scenario

NBenchmark's built-in outlier trimming (IQR fence by default, MAD on noisy hosts) and significance testing (Mann-Whitney U for two groups, Kruskal-Wallis for three or more) are designed for general-purpose benchmarking. They cover the common cases well, but they are not the only choices:

- **Latency SLOs** care about the tail, not the mean. Trimming the slow samples before computing statistics hides exactly the values a latency budget needs to see.
- **Fixed physical thresholds** ("any sample above 1 ms is a stall") don't adapt to the data's spread the way an IQR fence does.
- **Domain-specific rules** ("compare medians, not distributions") are simpler than a rank-based test and more interpretable for your team.
- **Bootstrap or Bayesian comparison** gives you a posterior over the difference rather than a single p-value.

Every statistical primitive in NBenchmark is pluggable. The built-in strategies all implement the same `IOutlierDetector` and `ISignificanceTest` interfaces, so you can swap in your own - or compose the built-in ones - without forking the engine.

## Complete example

### A custom outlier detector

A tail-preserving detector that keeps the fastest `fraction` of samples - useful for latency-SLO work where the slow tail is the signal, not noise to be trimmed:

```csharp
public sealed class KeepFastestDetector(double fraction) : IOutlierDetector
{
    public string Name => $"keep fastest {fraction * 100:0.#}%";

    public OutlierClassification Classify(double[] sortedSamples)
    {
        var keep = (int)Math.Floor(sortedSamples.Length * fraction);

        if (keep <= 0 || keep >= sortedSamples.Length)
            return OutlierClassification.KeepAll(sortedSamples);

        return new OutlierClassification
        {
            Kept = sortedSamples[..keep],
            Discarded = sortedSamples[keep..],
            UpperFence = sortedSamples[keep],
        };
    }
}
```

### A custom significance test

A median-ratio rule that marks a result significant when the median differs by more than a threshold percentage. No p-value, no distributional assumption - just "is the median more than X% off the baseline?":

```csharp
public sealed class MedianRatioSignificanceTest(double thresholdPercent) : ISignificanceTest
{
    public string Name => $"median ratio (>{thresholdPercent:0.#}%)";

    public SignificanceReport Analyze(SignificanceContext context)
    {
        var baseline = Median(context.Baseline.Samples);
        var pairwise = new List<PairwiseComparison>();

        foreach (var candidate in context.Candidates)
        {
            var deltaPercent = Math.Abs(Median(candidate.Samples) / baseline - 1.0) * 100.0;
            var verdict = deltaPercent > thresholdPercent
                ? SignificanceVerdict.Significant
                : SignificanceVerdict.NotSignificant;

            pairwise.Add(new PairwiseComparison(
                candidate.Name,
                PValue: null,
                Verdict: verdict,
                Effect: new EffectSize(
                    Metric: "median-ratio",
                    Value: deltaPercent,
                    Magnitude: deltaPercent switch
                    {
                        < 5 => "neg",
                        < 15 => "small",
                        < 30 => "med",
                        _ => "large",
                    },
                    Direction: EffectDirection.None,
                    PracticalValue: Math.Min(1.0, deltaPercent / 100.0))));
        }

        return new SignificanceReport { Pairwise = pairwise };
    }

    private static double Median(double[] samples)
    {
        var sorted = samples.OrderBy(x => x).ToArray();
        return sorted.Length % 2 == 0
            ? (sorted[sorted.Length / 2 - 1] + sorted[sorted.Length / 2]) / 2.0
            : sorted[sorted.Length / 2];
    }
}
```

### Wiring them in

In Suite mode:

```csharp
await new BenchmarkSuite("latency-slo")
    .Add("v1", () => CurrentImpl())
    .Add("v2", () => CandidateImpl())
    .WithBaseline("v1")
    .WithOutlierDetector(new KeepFastestDetector(0.90))
    .WithSignificanceTest(new MedianRatioSignificanceTest(thresholdPercent: 25))
    .WithReporter(new ConsoleReporter())
    .RunAsync();
```

In Single / Harness mode:

```csharp
new MeasurementOptions
{
    OutlierDetector = new KeepFastestDetector(0.90),
    SignificanceTest = new MedianRatioSignificanceTest(25),
}
```

## What's happening

- **`IOutlierDetector`** receives the sorted-ascending sample array and returns an `OutlierClassification` with `Kept`, `Discarded`, and optional `LowerFence` / `UpperFence`. The contract: never discard every sample (return `KeepAll` when your rule would empty the set), don't mutate the input, and return `Kept` sorted ascending. A custom `OutlierDetector` takes priority over `OutlierMode`. The detector's `Name` appears in the report header (`Outliers: ...`). See [Outlier Trimming: Custom outlier detectors](../statistics/outliers.md#custom-outlier-detectors).

- **`ISignificanceTest`** receives a `SignificanceContext` (the comparable `Groups`, the `BaselineIndex`, the `Baseline` group, the non-baseline `Candidates`, and the `SignificanceLevel`) and returns a `SignificanceReport` with `Pairwise` (one `PairwiseComparison` per candidate), optional `Effect` metadata, optional `Shift` estimate (the built-in strategies populate the Hodges-Lehmann shift), and optional `Omnibus` verdict for omnibus tests. Use `PValue: null` for rules that don't produce a p-value. See [Significance Testing: Custom significance tests](../statistics/significance.md#custom-significance-tests).

- **The `MinimumPracticalEffect` gate works for any test.** The engine enforces the gate in `Significance.ApplyReport` after the test runs, so a custom test that returns an `EffectSize` with a `PracticalValue` is gated automatically. Tests that don't return a practical value are unaffected. See [Significance Testing: Practical-significance gate](../statistics/significance.md#practical-significance-gate).

- **Isolated workers preserve your custom statistics.** Workers rebuild the suite from your own `Main` rather than deserializing options, so custom detector / test instances are preserved across the process boundary. In Harness mode, scalar CLI overrides (iterations, warmup, confidence, etc.) are forwarded to each worker. See [Isolated runs](../features/isolated-runs.md#important-behavior-notes).

> [!TIP] Compose the built-in strategies
> The built-in strategies - `MannWhitneyUSignificanceTest`, `KruskalWallisSignificanceTest`, and the group-count-aware `DefaultSignificanceTest` - all implement `ISignificanceTest`. You can wrap or compose them: run the built-in test, then add a domain-specific gate on top, or fall back to a custom rule when the built-in test returns `NotTested` (e.g. too few samples).

## Run it

```bash
# The custom detector's name shows up in the report header
dotnet run -c Release

# Outliers: keep fastest 90%
# Significance: median ratio (>25%)
```

```text
latency-slo
Benchmark | Median    | Mean     | Ops/s      | Ratio    | Sig | Mag   | Alloc/op
----------+-----------+----------+------------+----------+-----+-------+---------
v1        | 420.0 ns  | 422.3 ns | 2,380,952  | baseline |  -  |  -    |   128 B
v2        | 305.0 ns  | 307.1 ns | 3,278,689  | 0.73x    |  ✓  | large |    64 B
```

The custom detector and test are named in the header and footer so the report is self-describing - anyone reading it knows which statistics were applied.

## Read the results

The output is the same as any other run. The custom detector and test change which samples are kept and how significance is decided, but the columns, indicators, and warnings are unchanged. See [Reading Your Results](../output/reading-your-results.md).

One caveat: the `Magnitude` column reflects whatever your custom test returns in `EffectSize.Magnitude`. The built-in tests classify Cliff's delta into Negligible / Small / Medium / Large; a custom test can use any labels, but the console reporter color-codes based on the conventional labels. Stick to `neg` / `small` / `med` / `large` if you want the color coding to work.
